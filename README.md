## 📖 Description
Health Monitor is a real-time wearable system designed to keep track of key health metrics. Using ESP32 technology and a user-friendly Flutter app, this device monitors heart rate, SpO₂ (blood oxygen levels), ECG (heart activity), temperature, and falls. It sends data via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a smartphone for live visualization, alerts, and health insights. This application combines embedded systems, sensors, wireless technology, and mobile development to offer you a reliable health tracking solution.
